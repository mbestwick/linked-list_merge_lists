"""
Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head nodes of two sorted linked lists. The data
in both lists will be sorted in ascending order. Change the next pointers to
obtain a single, merged linked list which also has data in ascending order.
Either head pointer given may be null meaning that the corresponding list is
empty.

Input Format
You have to complete the Node* MergeLists(Node* headA, Node* headB) method which
takes two arguments - the heads of the two sorted linked lists to merge. You
should NOT read any input from stdin/console.

Output Format
Change the next pointer of individual nodes so that nodes from both lists are
merged into a single list. Then return the head of this merged list. Do NOT
print anything to stdout/console.
